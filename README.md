Hello friends here I have made a thread winding machine.

This machine wind thread from larger spool to smaller spool.
this machine is very much usefull for the onw who daily deals with thread winding like the operator in loom factory.
small scale textile owner etc.


# Component Used 

> 775 DC Motor
> liner rails
> timing belt 6mm
> timing pulley 6mm
> 20 x 20 profile
> Nextion HMI 
> Optical Encoder
> 5mm ID bearings 
> Custom PCB



Here I have used 12mm wooden sheet for the base of the machine. I roughly cut it with the help of jigsaw machine. 
then after I used table saw to finally cut according to reuired size.

Then I made the frame of 20 x 20 Alu. extrusion profile and place it on the top of wooden base

all the electromechanical components are going to be place on this frame.

Then I used my CNC router machine to cut this 6mm acrylic sheet this will hold the main shaft of spool 
one end of the shaft is connected with DC motor with the help of timming pulley.

now I installed the acrylic part to the 20x20 alu Propile facing to each other, and I have installed a 775DC on
on acrylic sheet .

Here I have used 9mm linear rail for left and right motion of thread, also I have printed two 3d parts 
to support the linear rail and T8 lead screw.

I place two 8mm id bearing for the smooth operation of lead screw

Then I connect the nema 17 stepper motor with 3D printed part and attached it to the alu. profile this stepper motor 
used to move the thread direction left and right.
