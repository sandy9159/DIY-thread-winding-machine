Hello friends here I have made a thread winding machine.

This machine wind thread from larger spool to smaller spool.
this machine is very much usefull for the onw who daily deals with thread winding like the operator in loom factory.
small scale textile owner etc.


# Component Used 

> 775 DC Motor
> liner rails
> timing belt 6mm
> timing pulley 6mm
> 20 x 20 profile
> Nextion HMI 
> Optical Encoder
> 5mm ID bearings 
> Custom PCB



Here I have used 12mm wooden sheet for the base of the machine. I roughly cut it with the help of jigsaw machine. 
then after I used table saw to finally cut according to reuired size.

Then I made the frame of 20 x 20 Alu. extrusion profile and place it on the top of wooden base

all the electromechanical components are going to be place on this frame.

Then I used my CNC router machine to cut this 6mm acrylic sheet this will hold the main shaft of spool 
one end of the shaft is connected with DC motor with the help of timming pulley.

now I installed the acrylic part to the 20x20 alu Propile facing to each other, and I have installed a 775DC on
on acrylic sheet .

Here I have used 9mm linear rail for left and right motion of thread, also I have printed two 3d parts 
to support the linear rail and T8 lead screw.

I place two 8mm id bearing for the smooth operation of lead screw

Then I connect the nema 17 stepper motor with 3D printed part and attached it to the alu. profile this stepper motor 
used to move the thread direction left and right.

If you want to build a project where the machine can control the speed of the conveyer belt as well as the direction of movement, a rotary encoder is a must-have component. Keeping this in mind, Robu.in is introducing the brand new orange 400 PPR 2-Phase Incremental Optical Rotary Encoder at a competitive price.

This is a 400 PPR resolution optical rotary encoder with quadrature outputs for increment counting. It will give 1600 transitions per rotation between outputs A and B. A quadrature decoder is required to convert the pulses to an up count. The Encoder is built to Industrial grade.

The Encoder comes with a Standard 1.5 m cable length which can be extended with extra cable if needed.

Adding a pull-up resistor to both the A and B phases of the encoder output will help to avoid the effect of interference in output and get the precise logical output value from the encoder at the same time. Also adding a pull-up resistor to all phase output lines protects the open collector output-triode from damage due to direct Vcc supply short circuit.

Terminal Name	        Wire Color	            Description
Phase A	                White	          Quadrature encoded output A
Phase B	                Green	          Quadrature encoded output B
VCC	                     Red	          VCC should be connected to +ve 5V of supply
GND	                    Black	          The ground should be connected to the negative of the supply
Shield	               Golden	          The shield should be connected to GND

At last user can input data like how long thread need to wind on spool and the press start.
after that winding automatically start and encoder record the length of thread pass through.]
when it reached to the set value arduino stop DC motor.
